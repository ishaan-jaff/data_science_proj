    "The purpose of this tutorial is to intorduce you to Markov chains and their applications to the world of Data Science and Machine Learning. We will discuss what Markov chains are, in what situations they can be useful and how to implement them in your own project. The primary purpose is to be able to create a Markov Model for the Job Market during the years of 2004-2015. If we are able to understand what the best strategy to get a job in Data Science, Software Engineering, Management was during 2004-2015 it could help us accelerate our job search strategy in the present. If you want that high paying job this tutorial could help you figure out how to make on average \\\\$117,345 per year as a Data Scientist, \\\\$103,035 per year as a Software Engineer/Developer or \\\\$73,818 per year as a Manager.

    "## What are Markov chains?\n",
    "A Markov chain can be defined as a mathematical system that is a collection of random variables that transition from one state to another based on transitions that satisfy the Markov property. The Markov property states that the probability of transitioning to any particular state is dependent solely on the current state and time elapsed, and not on the sequence of states that preceded it.\n",
    "We will define a random variable as a variable whose possible values are numerical outcomes of a random pehnomenon. For this tutorial we will focus on discrete random variables - Discrete random variables can take on only a countable number of distinct values. "

    "If you (the reader) are in State 1, i.e, are understanding the content of the tutorial(which I hope you are) then the probability you will transition to State 2, i.e, you enjoy the content of this tutorial is 0.3(30%). For each state you can move to another state or remain in the same state. If you model something using this process ensure that the sum of probabilities leaving a state = 1. The sum of transitions leaving State 3 = 0.2 + 0.8 = 1(100%). You want to define all possible states that you can transition to and from a particular state. \n",

They form the basis of search engine algorithms like page rank, they can be used to predict brand switching behaviour of customers(Chipotle might be interested in knowing the probability you switch loyalty to Cava next month, given that you are currently a loyal Chipotle customer) and they are even used to predict words being typed. If you ask a machine learning engineer how they would build a predictive model to generate text they would probably recommend using a Recurrent Neural Network. I would argue that a simple/traditional Markov model when implemented correctly could perform better than a deep learning model in certain cases. If you understand when and how to use these simple models you improve your performance as a Data Scientists, Machine Learning Engineer or human being. \n",

    "Step 1. As a beginner you may want to start working on time-series datasets. <br><br>\n",
    "Step 2. Before writing any code identify your state/segements. These can be Job Categories: Software Engineer, Data Science or they can be Consumer Types: Active, Inactive, Neutral or they can be Customer Engagement: High, Medium, Low. They can really be anything you choose, as long as they are finite. You can then use the pandas groupBy to create groups of your segments, you can also use an unsupervised algorithm such as k-means. Clustering algorithms are useful to cluster similar behaviour/data across rows.<br><br>\n",
    "Step 3. This is usually the most challenging aspect of using Markov Chains. There are several methods to define Transition Probabilites. You can use one of or multiple: <br>\n",
    "        - Basic Conditional Probability: P(F|E) = P(F ∩ E)/P(E)\n",
    "        - Bayes theorem: P(A|B) =  P(A) P(B|A)*P(B)\n",
    "        - Define your own transition probabilities, using historical data from your dataset.\n",
    "          (Later in this tutorial we actually define our own transition probabilities using a dataset)\n",
    "Step 4. Once we have our transition probabilities, our goal is to build a model to simulate our end state probabilities. Markov chains are best represented using matrix-vector multiplication.

    "## Conclusion \n",
    "When considering the transition matrix for our jobs we can conclude the following: \n",
    "During 2004 - 2015 it was easier to transition from Software Engineer -> Manager than it was to transition from Data Scientist -> Manager. <br>\n",
    "It is much easier and more likely to move from a technical role to a non-technical role. During 2004 - 2015, if you started your career as a Software Engineer or Data Scientist it would have been easy for you to move into the position of being a Manager. However, if you wanted to move from Manager to Software or Data Science it would have been much more challening. <br>\n",
    "Markov Chains Make several assumptions: \n",
    "    - There are a finite set of states\n",
    "    - The probabilities of moving between states are fixed\n",
    "    - There are no restrictions on moving in between states\n",
    "When looking at our final plot generate, there is a point at which the rate of change of jobs slows down. This is due to the assumption that the probabilities of moving between states are fixed. The next step in this tutorial would be to improve this model we have by updating our transition probabilities between each year. This would lead to more accuracy and a better simulation of the real world. \n"
